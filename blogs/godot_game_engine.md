# Godot Game Engine

## Introduction

Godot is a free and open-source game engine released under the MIT license. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for game development, supporting both 2D and 3D graphics. With an active community and extensive documentation, Godot is an excellent choice for beginners and experienced developers alike.

## Key Features

### 1. **Open Source**

Godot is completely free and open-source, allowing developers to modify the engine to suit their needs. The source code is available on GitHub, fostering a collaborative environment where improvements and features can be contributed by anyone.

### 2. **Node System**

Godot's scene system is built around nodes, which are the building blocks of the engine. Each node serves a specific purpose, such as displaying graphics, playing sounds, or handling physics. Nodes can be combined in a tree structure to create complex scenes and game logic.

### 3. **Flexible Scripting**

Godot uses its own scripting language called GDScript, which is similar to Python and easy to learn. Additionally, the engine supports other languages like C#, VisualScript, and C++ for developers who prefer or require them.

### 4. **2D and 3D Support**

Godot excels in both 2D and 3D game development. It includes a dedicated 2D engine that is optimized for performance and packed with features like lights, shadows, and shaders. For 3D development, Godot offers a full suite of tools, including a powerful renderer, physics engine, and animation system.

### 5. **Cross-Platform**

Games developed with Godot can be exported to a variety of platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and HTML5. This makes it easy to reach a broad audience without needing to significantly alter the codebase.

### 6. **Visual Editor**

Godot provides a comprehensive visual editor that allows developers to design scenes and interfaces with ease. The editor includes a powerful animation toolset, a built-in debugger, and a live scene editing feature that lets you make changes while the game is running.
